                <p>It is said that the name Mojokerto comes from two words, namely "Mojo", which is the name of a Maja tree that grows a lot in one of the villages there, and "Kerto", which comes from the word kerta raharja, which means calm. So that Mojokerto can be interpreted as a place where the Maja tree grows in peace. The change of the name of Japan Regency to Mojokerto was confirmed through the decision of the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies on September 12, No. 1838.  </p>  
                <p>According to historical records, the name Mojokerto is also related to the Majapahit Kingdom, which left many ancient objects in this region. Mojokerto was the former capital of the Majapahit Kingdom, a large kingdom in the archipelago that stood between the 13th and 15th centuries.</p>
